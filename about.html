    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>i wanted to create a more authentic way for people to meet through my own network. each person is vetted by me.</p>  
    <p>i've decided to use this project to list my friends and my unrealised dreams and ideas; to somewhat promote some sort of accountability and see if we could help one another overcome the challenges or hurdles we foresee.</p>
    <p>at initialisation, the vision is to fulfil our most selfish ideas ethically. i believe altruism can only be attained by putting ourselves first. being selfish is the first step to being selfless.</p>
    <p>upon expansion, the goal is to be a platform for members to participate through investment &#8212; physical, mental or financial. there will be tools available to fulfil members' ideas, be it hardware or software. the details will be refined subsequently as we grow, slowly. ideally, a good portion of any profit will go to growing the next ethical selfless idea.</p>
    <p>there's no big philosophical or financial ambition here. i just want the members &#8212; my friends &#8212; to enjoy a full life. one that they could call theirs.</p>
