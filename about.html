    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>i wanted to create a more authentic way for people to meet through my own network. each person is vetted by me.</p> 
    <p>this page started as a dating app, but i realised that it's not the best way to connect with people and i didn't want to exclude people who are already in a relationship. the other goal that i have is to gather people who are interested in building but lack the means to for any reason. for now, this is exclusive to my network of friends.</p>
    <p>everyone's motive is clearly indicated on their profile and each person has his/her interests so you can find someone who shares the same interests as you or not. the primary goal of this website is to promote socialisation in person with the people you want. i'm aware that some people want to socialise in person but may be too introverted so i have some ideas to diffuse the meetings. these ideas would be available on a later date. the primary focus of these meetings is to socialise as politely as possible but not be obsequious, simply be yourself because i've already vet each profile and my gut feeling of people is never wrong. there's at least some good in the people i ok-ed. be yourself, the sooner you be you the sooner people who are looking for you will find you. at the end of the day, you're all of my friends so try to be amiable.</p>
   <h2>what features may i introduce?</h2>
   <p>i'm thinking about adding some chat rooms that people can see publicly about some topics. i encourage participants to discuss whatever opinions they have regarding that topic so others can view your opinion and get a gauge of your character through your writings. this way, people who are interested in what you say can contact you and people who are not interested can stay away. </p>
