    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>i wanted to create a more authentic way for people to meet through my own network via sharing ideas. each person is vetted by me.</p>  
    <p>i have decided to use this project to list my friends' and my unrealised dreams, or in more practical terms, ideas. it promotes some sort of accountability &#8212; to see if we could help one another overcome the challenges or hurdles we foresee &#8212; and create synergetic outcomes together.</p>
    <p>the ultimate goal is to use this platform to gather like-minded builders/artists to improve the places we visit before we leave them. in that sense, altruism is what i'm envisioning through ethical and profitable means. </p>
    <p>the first step is to admit individuals who are highly agentic. if you are not sure what it means, you may wish to refer to this <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/agency?r=2q4mch&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true" target="_blank">article</a> by henrik karlsson. the next steps are to fulfil their most selfish ideas ethically. </p>
    <p>i believe altruism can only be attained by putting ourselves first. being selfish is the beginning to being selfless. of course, the ideas shared need to be ethical and <a href="https://kingstonkoh.com/artandbusiness" target="_blank">absolutely profitable</a>. once the idea is ethically and financially sound, the following step is to monetise it. without resources, longevity is impossible. no one is excusable in the face of economics. it's simply a resource game, one that needs to be managed and organised well.</p>
    <p>upon expansion, the goal is to be a platform for members to participate through investment: physical, mental, or financial. in exchange, they will be rewarded with monetary and/or equity. there will be tools available to fulfil members' ideas, be it hardware or software. the details will be refined subsequently as we grow, intentionally. ideally, a good portion of any profit will go to growing the next ethical and profitable selfless idea.</p>
    <p>there's no grand philosophical or financial ambition here. i just want the members &#8212; my friends &#8212; to enjoy a full life. one that they could call theirs instead of following the traditional route for a career in singapore. i am convinced that their lives will be a lot better when they can live their lives idiosyncratically. there is simply no mold for life. fuck ‘your network is your net worth’ and just do you, be agentic and set your worth; your value and potential are your worth, spend your dying breaths wisely.</p>
