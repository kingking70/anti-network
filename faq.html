    <h2>what is anti-network?</h2>
    <p>anti-network is a website/community in singapore built by me while i was convalescing. i wanted more authentic friends so i decided to build anti-network. it is a website to forge authentic relationships through socialising in person.</p>
    <h2>how to join?</h2>
    <p>you'd need to know one of the founders to join, and you're in luck because the founders are looking for friends too. just fill up the contact form found in the about page.</p>
    <h2>that person was dishonest or impolite!</h2>
    <p>please report to the founders if their friends have not been honest with their intentions or disrespected you in any way.</p>
    <h2>what are the logistics for meeting up?</h2>
    <p>i can provide suggestions for y'all if you don't have a clue.</p>
    <h2>will there be new features?</h2>
    <p>i'll maybe push out chats (chat rooms) for y'all.</p>
