    <h2>what is anti-network?</h2>
    <p>anti-network is a website/community in singapore built by me while i was convalescing. i wanted more builders and artists as friends so i decided to build anti-network. it is a website to forge authentic relationships through socialising with ideas, and eventually in person, in hopes to build synergetic projects. you can find more the website's philosophy in the <a href="./about.html">about</a> page.</p>
    <h2>how to join?</h2>
    <p>you'd need to know me to join and you're in luck because the i'm looking for friends. just fill up this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7qDBg4dWoxdDopEmPSS45W6fYjq_fuCVK74XEgOvj5ecrXw/viewform?usp=preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questionnaire</a> or meet me in person.</p>
    <h2>who am i looking for?</h2>
    <p>individuals who want to live a life they can deeply call their own. people who prefer long formats and discussions instead of the current brain rot information. i don't deny that short content has its pros but i'm not interested in befriending people who identify themselves with it. </p>
    <h2>how do i contact anyone?</h2>
    <p>drop me an <a href="mailto:kingston.kdk@gmail.com?subject=i%20need%20your%20help%20">email</a> and let me know who you'd like to speak to, at kingston.kdk@gmail.com</p>
    <h2>will there be a physical meet up?</h2>
    <p>preferably a place where individuals would not be able to smoke. i guess a bit of alcohol will be fine. i'm interested in a private space where builders can build, artists can do perform their art, and discuss ideas, not party and network for its sake. there'll most likely be physical events starting from dec 2025 as the best way to collaborate is still physical and active presence. i'm also thinking of other options like a discord or some chat sort of secured chat room, dependent on the project. i'll get back to this when i'm fully recovered in end oct/nov 2025.</p>
    <h2>what features may i introduce?</h2>
    <p>i don't know, yet. everything will slowly be implemented according to suggestions. this way, its growth is organic. thanks for reading.</p>
