    <h2>what is anti-network?</h2>
    <p>anti-network is a website/community in singapore built by me while i was convalescing. i wanted more builders and artists as friends so i decided to build anti-network. it is a website to forge authentic relationships through socialising with ideas, and eventually in person, in hopes to build synergetic projects.</p>
    <h2>how to join?</h2>
    <p>you'd need to know one of the founders to join, and you're in luck because the founders are looking for friends too. just fill up the questionnaire found in the about page.</p>
    <h2>how do i contact anyone?</h2>
    <p>drop me an <a href="mailto:kingston.kdk@gmail.com?subject=i%20need%20your%20help%20">email</a> and tell me who you're looking to speak to at kingston.kdk@gmail.com</p>
    <h2>will there be a physical meet up?</h2>
    <p>i'll return to this once when i'm fully recovered. as of aug 2025, there're no definite plans. i'm expected to recover by oct/nov 2025. there'll most likely be physical events starting from dec 2025 as the best way to collaborate is still physical and active presence. </p>
    <h2>what features may i introduce?</h2>
    <p>i don't know, yet. everything will slowly be implemented according to suggestions. this way, its growth is organic. and i have no plans to monetise this page as of aug 2025. thanks for reading.</p>
